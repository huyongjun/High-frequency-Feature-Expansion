# High-frequency-Feature-Expansion
Text Classification Based on Topic Model with HighÔºçFrequency Feature Expansion
    Short text differs from traditional documents in its shortness and sparseness. Feature extension can ease the problem of high 
sparseness in the vector space model, but it inevitably introduces noise. To resolve this problem, our paper proposes a high-frequency 
feature expansion method based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model. High-frequency features are extracted from each 
category as the feature space, using LDA to derive latent topics from the corpus, and topic words are extended to the short text. 
Extensive experiments are conducted on Chinese short messages and news titles. The proposed method for classifying Chinese short texts 
outperforms conventional classification methods.
